Round Four – The Examination
The Scenario:
You have returned to the Wine Vaults with a flashlight in hand. In the light, you can see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost get lost. Coming upon the body, you confirm that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately see the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appears to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevents you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decide to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
You last saw Elizabeth Killingsworth alive around 3:45 PM when you passed by the farmhouse and overheard her talking to Dr. Chelsea Barren about her book. You then continued on your bird watching walk in the fields.
You had just finished a business phone call in the study when you saw Kathryn Lawless approach Michael Nightshade. He was sitting in his car just outside the study window. You heard bits and pieces of a hushed conversation and you are certain that you heard Michael Nightshade say, “Are you sure about this, Aunt Kathryn?” She then handed him a small pill bottle.
You were bird watching most of the afternoon. You were out in the grape fields when you noticed the Wine Vault lights flicker and go out. You thought it was odd, but then you heard Vicki screaming. You ran inside the Wine Vaults from the back door, but soon got lost in the labyrinth of halls. You did not find Vicki until you came back into the Farmhouse and saw the other guests.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
At 2:00 PM, you were in your room with Vicki. She was distraught that Elizabeth would not give her a loan. Vicki broke down and cried right in front of you.
You were bird watching in the Rose Garden's Gazebo at 5:30 PM. You saw your wife flirting and kissing Enrique Graves.
