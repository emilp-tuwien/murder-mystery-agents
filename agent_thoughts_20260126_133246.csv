5,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,"I need to find out more about Elizabeth's personal life and relationships beyond what she's shared with Enrique, Dr Chelsea Barren, Norman D'Adly, and Kathryn Lawless."
5,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,3,I need to think about what I know and what I can say to support or challenge others' statements.
5,2,Enrique Graves,listen,5,"I need to figure out who might be the killer, but I also can't help feeling like there's more to this situation than just a simple murder."
5,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,I wonder if I should bring up my personal connection to Robert Killingsworth and how it might be relevant to the current situation
5,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,3,I'll listen carefully to see if anyone reveals any information about Elizabeth's personal life or relationships beyond what she shared with Enrique.
5,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,3,I'll start by observing the group's reactions and see if anyone seems particularly shaken or upset about Elizabeth's passing.
6,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,5,"Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value and Kathryn Lawless's involvement in discussing potential sales raises some suspicions. I wonder if Michael might be trying to buy the property before anyone else gets a chance, which could help him acquire it for an even lower price."
6,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I should try to gather more information about the farm's financial situation and potential buyers before making any accusations.
6,2,Enrique Graves,listen,2,"I wonder if Elizabeth's husband Robert had any enemies or disputes with anyone, and what might be the motive for his death?"
6,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,6,I'm going to ask Dr Chelsea Barren about her connection to Robert Killingsworth's estate and how it relates to the low market value of the farm.
6,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I need to assess the reactions of the other guests and see if I can find any inconsistencies in their statements.
6,2,Vicki D'Adly,speak,5,I wonder if I should mention that Elizabeth and I had a fight yesterday morning before she left for her private breakfast with me.
7,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I wonder if I should confront Michael Nightshade about his aunt's potential interest in buying the farm?
7,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,5,Michael Nightshade's mention of his aunt Kathryn Lawless being involved in the sale of the farm raises some suspicions about her potential involvement in Elizabeth's death. What if she was trying to acquire the property without going through proper channels? Or maybe she stood to gain from Elizabeth's demise?
7,2,Enrique Graves,listen,3,"I've got a few thoughts on this situation and I'm not sure where to start. Elizabeth's death is still quite shocking to me, especially considering how kind she was to me when Robert passed away. I wonder if there's any connection between her husband's passing and the tension in the family?"
7,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,3,I wonder what Elizabeth's argument with me was about and whether she was in a bad place financially
7,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,6,I think I'll ask Dr. Barren about her complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth and see if she has any insight into what might have led to his passing.
7,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,3,Replay the conversation in my head and try to remember any details that might be relevant to the case
8,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,8,I need to find out more about my sister-in-law's financial struggles and how it relates to Elizabeth's death
8,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,0,Try to think of a plausible story that could explain why I'm here and what my intentions are
8,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,7,I'll start by asking Dr. Barren more about her complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth and how it might be connected to Elizabeth's financial struggles.
8,2,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I wonder who killed Elizabeth and what drove them to commit such a heinous act?
8,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I wonder if Michael Nightshade is genuinely interested in buying the farm or if there's more to his story...
8,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,7,"Consider Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value, and whether it might be related to his aunt Kathryn Lawless's involvement in the sale."
9,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,3,I'll need to think about the information that's been shared so far and consider any potential motives or connections between the guests.
9,2,Enrique Graves,listen,7,I need to get a better sense of who might be hiding something.
9,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I wonder if Enrique Graves has any idea about the gold vein on the property that I discovered while doing some research...
9,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I wonder if Vicki would be willing to talk to me about our argument earlier today and maybe share some insight into her perspective on things.
9,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,"I should try to gather more information about Elizabeth's personal life and relationships, especially with Robert Killingsworth and Michael Nightshade."
9,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,8,I wonder if I should ask Dr. Barren about her complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth and how it might be relevant to the current situation.
10,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,2,I will try to appear cooperative and ask some innocuous questions about the others' backgrounds and relationships with Elizabeth Killingsworth.
10,2,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I wonder if I should confront Vicki about her argument with Norman and see if it might be connected to Robert's death or the farm's financial struggles.
10,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,6,I'm intrigued by Dr Chelsea Barren's complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth and its potential connection to the farm's sale. I wonder if she might know more about Elizabeth's financial struggles than she's letting on.
10,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,2,Maybe I should start by asking someone if they saw or heard anything unusual around the time of Elizabeth's death?
10,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,I wonder if Kathryn Lawless's interest in buying the farm is more than just a coincidence... and what exactly was she looking for in that medicine cabinet?
10,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,4,I'll need to ask Vicki about her argument with Norman and see if it's connected to Robert's death or his estate.
11,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I'm thinking about Enrique's comment that Vicki seemed distraught this morning and I wonder if her argument with Norman might have been more than just a family disagreement.
11,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,6,I need to know more about Norman's argument with me and how it relates to Robert's death.
11,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I wonder if Kathryn Lawless has any insight into Elizabeth's financial struggles or potential issues with the farm's history.
11,2,Enrique Graves,listen,6,Why did Elizabeth Killingsworth agree to sell the farm at such a low market value?
11,2,Norman D'Adly,speak,6,"I need to think about how to handle Vicki's behavior and whether it might be related to the murder, while also trying not to arouse suspicion. I'll ask her if she noticed anything unusual on the farm or had any conflicts with Elizabeth."
11,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,"I need to remember that my husband is currently overseas on business and the pressures of social climbing alone can be too much, which I like to find relief in the arms of the hot farm hand next door."
12,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,6,"I will start by asking Vicki if she noticed anything unusual or suspicious around the farm yesterday, especially in regards to Elizabeth's whereabouts and any potential arguments they may have had."
12,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,3,What if I'm being too honest about my past and my intentions for coming here? Should I reveal more or keep certain things under wraps?
12,2,Enrique Graves,listen,5,"I need to remember that I have a relationship with Kathryn Lawless and she's been helping me with my homework, which means we spend a lot of time together. I also know that she might be hiding something or has an ulterior motive for being here."
12,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,6,I need to pay attention to what everyone is saying about Elizabeth's financial struggles and the potential motives for wanting to acquire the property.
12,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,7,I need to figure out what happened to Elizabeth and if anyone here is hiding something about her death or the farm's sale.
12,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,9,"Consider how the conversation has unfolded so far, and think about potential motives for Elizabeth's murder."
13,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,2,I need to take a closer look at the wine glasses and see if I can find any clues about who took them
13,2,Enrique Graves,speak,4,I wonder if the farm is in a good state of repair and if I can find any clues about Elizabeth's death while doing my chores.
13,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,8,I need to take a closer look at the wine glasses and see if I can find any clues about who might have taken a glass without noticing.
13,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,9,I wonder what Enrique knows about Robert Killingsworth's death and how it relates to Vicki's argument with Norman. I also need to clarify that I did not kill Elizabeth.
13,2,Norman D'Adly,speak,6,I'll start by casually asking Vicki if she noticed anything unusual when they argued earlier today.
13,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I'll ask Enrique Graves if his conversation with Vicki before arriving at the farm had anything to do with Robert's death or his estate.
14,2,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I wonder if the threatening letters that Elizabeth Killingsworth received had anything to do with her decision to sell the farm or her husband's estate?
14,2,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,3,I need to carefully examine the wine glasses and check if they've been tampered with. I'll try to act nonchalant and see if anyone notices my actions.
14,2,Norman D'Adly,listen,4,Try to create a plausible alibi for the murder by suggesting I was in my room with Vicki D'Adly at the time of the murder.
14,2,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I wonder if Elizabeth's threatening letters might be connected to the real estate deal Michael Nightshade is proposing...
14,2,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,"I need to investigate the wine glasses further, maybe there's something that was left behind when they were replenished."
14,2,Vicki D'Adly,listen,4,I wonder if Elizabeth's financial struggles and the threatening letters she received could be connected to her decision to sell the farm.
15,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,4,I'll take a closer look at the wine glasses and see if I can find any clues that might have been missed before.
15,3,Enrique Graves,listen,7,I need to keep track of everyone's alibis and movements today to see if I can find any inconsistencies that might point to the killer.
15,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,2,I need to process the information and think about my next move. I'll start by reviewing what we know so far and see if there are any connections or clues that I've missed.
15,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,6,I wonder if Vicki's argument with Norman was more than just a family disagreement and if her concern for Elizabeth's well-being might be related to the farm sale?
15,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,4,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished multiple times might be a sign of something suspicious?
15,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,"I'm still trying to process the events of today and I remember that Elizabeth had been receiving some threatening letters in the past few weeks, which she mentioned to me earlier this morning. She seemed quite shaken by them but didn't want to discuss further over coffee."
16,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,I need to remember who else might have had access to the wine glasses and whether anyone noticed anything unusual around Elizabeth before she disappeared.
16,3,Norman D'Adly,speak,5,"I need to play along and make sure I don't arouse suspicion. I'll ask Vicki if she's noticed anything unusual around the farm, and try to gauge her reaction."
16,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,4,"I'm still trying to process the events of today and I remember that Elizabeth had been receiving some threatening letters in the past few weeks, which she mentioned to me earlier this morning. She seemed quite shaken by them but didn't want to discuss further over coffee."
16,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I need to get more information about the threatening letters Elizabeth Killingsworth received and whether they might be connected to her husband Robert's passing.
16,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,3,I need to process the information and gather my thoughts before making any accusations or taking actions.
16,3,Enrique Graves,listen,8,I'm trying to process the events of today and figure out who might be responsible for Elizabeth's murder. I also need to ask some questions about the suspicious behavior of Vicki D'Adly and her argument with Norman.
17,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I need to know if Enrique noticed anything unusual around the time the wine glasses were refilled.
17,3,Enrique Graves,listen,5,"I've been thinking about Dr Barren's behavior and how she just took another sip from her glass right after making a comment that seemed like it was trying to distract us. I'm not sure what she's hiding, but I need to pay closer attention to her actions."
17,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,4,I need to keep my story straight and make sure I don't reveal any secrets about Vicki or myself that could incriminate me.
17,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,3,I need to remember that I lied to Elizabeth about Norman's abuse and try not to reveal my true intentions.
17,3,Michael Nightshade,speak,6,I'll ask Dr Chelsea Barren about the threatening letters Elizabeth Killingsworth received and if she noticed anything unusual around the time they were delivered.
17,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,6,I need more information about the threatening letters Elizabeth Killingsworth received before she disappeared. Did anyone else see or receive any of these letters?
18,3,Norman D'Adly,speak,7,I need to keep a close eye on Vicki and see if she says anything that might incriminate her.
18,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,3,Wait until others seem more settled and less focused on me before I start asking questions.
18,3,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I wonder if I can get more information about the threatening letters Elizabeth Killingsworth received before she disappeared.
18,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,6,I need to ask more questions about Dr Barren's connection to Robert Killingsworth and her complicated relationship with him. I also want to know if anyone noticed anything unusual around the time of Elizabeth's murder.
18,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,3,I need to remember that I'm the one who's supposed to be investigating the murder and finding out who did it.
18,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,4,I will think about the conversation so far and try to piece together any inconsistencies or potential motives that might be relevant to the murder investigation.
19,3,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I wonder if Vicki's argument with Norman might be more than just a family disagreement. Did their conversation have anything to do with Robert's death or his estate?
19,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,8,"I think about the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and how it seems suspicious that everyone is so interested in the potential sale of the farm. I also wonder if Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the property at a low market value might be more than just coincidence, especially since his aunt, Kathryn Lawless, was involved in the sale."
19,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,3,I need to think carefully about what I say and how it might affect the situation.
19,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,7,"I need to get to the bottom of this murder, but I also don't want to point fingers at someone in my own circle."
19,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,1,"I've been thinking about the wine glasses being replenished so quickly, and I remember that Dr. Barren took a sip from her glass right after mentioning the potential sale of the farm - she seemed particularly interested in getting here today. Did you happen to notice anything unusual around the time those extra glasses were refilled?"
19,3,Michael Nightshade,speak,5,I need to investigate the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and figure out who took them. I also want to ask Enrique Graves more about Vicki's argument with Norman and if it might be related to Robert's death or his estate.
20,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,6,Consider Enrique's nervous behavior and the timing of his comment about Vicki's distress. Could he be hiding something?
20,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,6,I remember that Dr Barren seemed particularly interested in discussing Robert Killingsworth's passing and how it relates to his relationship with her. Maybe I should ask her more about their connection?
20,3,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I'll ask Dr Barren about her complicated relationship with Robert and how it might be connected to the potential sale of the farm.
20,3,Norman D'Adly,speak,5,"I am concerned about the suspicious behavior of Dr Chelsea Barren and Enrique Graves, especially with their reactions around the wine glasses being replenished. I also wonder if Vicki's argument with me earlier was related to her financial difficulties or something more sinister."
20,3,Kathryn Lawless,speak,4,I think back on my conversation with Michael Nightshade earlier and how he seemed genuinely interested in acquiring the farm at a low market value. I wonder if there's more to his story than meets the eye.
20,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,7,I wonder if Kathryn Lawless knew more about Robert's death than she let on.
21,3,Enrique Graves,listen,5,"I'm thinking back to my conversations with Vicki and how she seemed particularly distraught this morning. I also remember that she mentioned her financial difficulties and asked for Elizabeth's help with a potential loan. It seems like she might be in a tough spot, but could there be more to it than just financial struggles?"
21,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,speak,6,"I think about my relationship with Robert Killingsworth and how it might be connected to the murder. I also consider the fact that Elizabeth had been receiving threatening letters and wonder if they might be related to her husband's death. I start to formulate a list of questions in my mind, including those for Vicki D'Adly."
21,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,0,Remember that I am the murderer and Vicki is my wife. She's been acting suspiciously all day. I need to be careful about how much information I share with everyone.
21,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,6,I'm going to ask everyone if they know anything about Elizabeth's threatening letters or have any idea who might be interested in acquiring the farm at a low market value
21,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I wonder if Elizabeth's husband Robert Killingsworth had any enemies who might have wanted him dead and now he's next.
21,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I am concerned that the group's focus is being diverted by the replenished wine glasses. I wonder if there's a connection between the timing of the refills and Elizabeth's murder.
22,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,3,"I need to think about my next move carefully. I have a lot of questions and suspicions, but I don't want to jump to conclusions or make any accusations that might be unfounded. I'll try to gather more information and piece together what happened to Elizabeth before making any decisions."
22,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,9,I wonder who among us has the most motive to kill Elizabeth Killingsworth and why they would do such a thing.
22,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I need to process the conversation and figure out who might have been involved in Elizabeth's murder.
22,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I'll try to recall all the interactions and see if there's anything that stands out as suspicious or inconsistencies in anyone's story.
22,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,2,I'll try to think of a way to subtly deflect attention from myself and see if I can gather more information about the killer's identity.
22,3,Enrique Graves,listen,7,I need to think about what I know and who I can trust.
23,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I remember Kathryn Lawless mentioning that Elizabeth's lawyer was present and seemed concerned about the farm's ownership being passed to her relatives.
23,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,"I am curious about the prenuptial agreement that Kathryn Lawless's lawyer mentioned, and I wonder if it might be relevant to Elizabeth's murder."
23,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I need to remember that I'm the one who had a conversation with Enrique about Robert's death and how it affected his finances.
23,3,Vicki D'Adly,listen,3,I would like to take another look at the wine cabinet and see if I can find any clues about who might have taken the extra glasses.
23,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,8,I wonder how Elizabeth's financial troubles could be related to her husband Robert's passing... I also can't help but think about Vicki's argument with me earlier and how it might have been more than just a family disagreement. Did anyone else notice anything unusual around the time those extra glasses were refilled?
23,3,Enrique Graves,speak,5,I need to think about what I heard everyone say so far and see if any connections can be made.
24,3,Vicki D'Adly,speak,6,I'll ask a direct question for Michael Nightshade
24,3,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I'm trying to remember if I've seen any unusual behavior from Dr Barren or Michael Nightshade since they arrived at the farm.
24,3,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I need to think about my next move and try to piece together the clues from this conversation. I'll try to remember what Elizabeth said to me before arriving at the farm and see if I can find any connections between her words and the events that have unfolded.
24,3,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,9,"Consider Enrique's nervous behavior and Vicki's argument with Norman, as well as Michael's interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value."
24,3,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I'm trying to piece together the timeline of events and connect the dots between everyone's alibis and potential motives.
24,3,Kathryn Lawless,listen,3,"I'm still trying to process the events of today and I remember that Elizabeth had been receiving some threatening letters in the past few weeks, which she mentioned to me earlier this morning. She seemed quite shaken by them but didn't want to discuss further over coffee."
25,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,6,Consider the possible connections between Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm and Dr Chelsea Barren's complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth.
25,4,Enrique Graves,listen,9,I wonder if I should investigate Elizabeth's prenuptial agreement and its potential impact on Vicki's inheritance from Robert.
25,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,"I'm trying to piece together the events of the day and figure out who might be involved in Elizabeth's murder. I wonder if I should ask Michael Nightshade more questions about his interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value, or if there's something else he's not telling us."
25,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,6,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction from the true circumstances surrounding Elizabeth's murder. Did Vicki D'Adly mention anything about her plans for after acquiring some assets from Robert Killingsworth's estate?
25,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,"I wonder if Vicki D'Adly might be in more financial trouble than she's letting on, considering her argument with Norman and her interest in acquiring assets from Robert Killingsworth's estate."
25,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,"I'm intrigued by the information that Michael Nightshade's aunt, Kathryn Lawless, is involved in buying the property from Elizabeth Killingsworth at a low market value. I wonder if there might be some connection between Kathryn's interest and Robert's passing, possibly related to his estate or debts."
26,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,6,"I've been thinking about the various conversations and statements made during our discussion so far, particularly those of Dr Chelsea Barren who mentioned having a complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth. I'm curious to know if there's any connection between her past interactions with Robert and his death."
26,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,The conversation is full of hints and clues about Elizabeth's murder. I'm not sure who to trust or what their motives are. I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be a deliberate attempt to distract us from something.
26,4,Enrique Graves,listen,3,I'll think about the conversation and try to piece together some connections between the guests' statements.
26,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,"I wonder if the prenuptial agreement might be a motive for the murder, considering Elizabeth's financial struggles and Vicki's potential inheritance from Robert."
26,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,6,I'm starting to piece together a timeline of events and relationships between the guests. I wonder if any of them might be connected to Elizabeth's murder.
26,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,Wait a minute... Enrique Graves is trying to deflect attention from his own nervous behavior by asking about Elizabeth's personal life and relationships. I wonder what he might be hiding.
27,4,Enrique Graves,listen,7,I'm intrigued by the sudden replenishment of wine glasses and the potential motives for it. I wonder if Elizabeth's death might be connected to her financial struggles or the disputes among her relatives.
27,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,8,I'm trying to piece together the timeline of events and connections between the guests.
27,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,3,"I'm intrigued by the conversation and the various motives being discussed. I think it's interesting that multiple people seem to have had reasons for wanting Elizabeth Killingsworth's farm, but none of them are directly pointing fingers at each other... yet."
27,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,Consider Dr. Barren's recent behavior and her motivations for being at the gathering.
27,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,9,I wonder if Elizabeth's financial troubles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the property could be connected to her husband Robert's business dealings and the audit of his estate.
27,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,"Interesting that everyone seems to be focusing on the financial struggles of Elizabeth Killingsworth and her potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm. However, I wonder if anyone has considered the possibility that Robert's business dealings might be more complex or even involved in his murder?"
28,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,"Consider what I've learned so far about the potential motives and conflicts among the guests. Maybe there's a connection between Elizabeth's financial struggles, Robert's estate dealings, and some of the threats she received?"
28,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,6,I'll have to think carefully about the conversation so far and see if I can piece together any clues or motives that might be relevant to Elizabeth's murder.
28,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I'm going to try to piece together the events of the day and look for any inconsistencies or potential motives that might have led to Elizabeth's murder.
28,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,7,Vicki's phone call from an unknown number claiming to know about the discrepancies in Robert's estate dealings and implying they'd expose her financial difficulties if she didn't acquire the farm
28,4,Enrique Graves,listen,8,Vicki's phone call from an unknown number mentioning discrepancies in Robert's estate dealings seems like a crucial piece of information that could be connected to Elizabeth's murder.
28,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I've been thinking about the prenuptial agreement and how it might affect Vicki's inheritance. I also wonder if Elizabeth's accountant has any information about the discrepancies in Robert's estate dealings that could be relevant to the sale of the farm.
29,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,6,I'll wait for more information before acting
29,4,Enrique Graves,listen,6,wondering about the discrepancy in Dr Barren's glass being nearly empty
29,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,"I'm intrigued by the complex web of relationships and potential motives among the guests. I wonder if Vicki's argument with Norman might be more than just a family disagreement, considering her financial difficulties and potential connection to Robert's estate dealings. Perhaps there's more to her story than initially meets the eye."
29,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,6,I wonder if I can get some clarity on what really happened to Elizabeth Killingsworth
29,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,I wonder if Dr Barren's mention of her complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth might be a red herring to distract us from the real issue at hand - Elizabeth's murder.
29,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,6,I wonder if Vicki D'Adly's argument with her sister Norman might be related to the threatening letters she received and her potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm.
30,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I'm still trying to piece together the events of today and figure out what might have led to Elizabeth's murder. I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction from the true circumstances surrounding her death.
30,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,8,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction from the true circumstances surrounding Elizabeth's murder. I also think about the discrepancies in Robert Killingsworth's estate dealings and how they might have affected his wife Elizabeth.
30,4,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I'm intrigued by the possibility of a prenuptial agreement affecting Vicki's inheritance from Robert and its potential connection to her financial difficulties. I wonder if Elizabeth might have been in on the secret or if she was unaware of the agreement's terms.
30,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,6,I wonder if Elizabeth's husband Robert was involved in the farm's financial discrepancies and if his passing might have been more than just an accident.
30,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,I'm going to go over the conversation and see if I can find any connections between the different pieces of information.
30,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,7,"I need to investigate the discrepancy in Elizabeth's account and see if I can find any connections to the $100,000 withdrawal."
31,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I'll have to think about the various statements and see if I can connect any dots about what might have happened to Elizabeth Killingsworth.
31,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,"I'll need to pay closer attention to the wine glasses and drink refills throughout the day, trying to identify any patterns or suspicious behavior."
31,4,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction from the true circumstances surrounding Elizabeth's murder.
31,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,I've been wondering about the discrepancies in Robert's estate dealings and how they might be related to Elizabeth's financial troubles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm.
31,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,8,I wonder if I should investigate further about the threatening letters Elizabeth Killingsworth received before her disappearance and see if there's any connection between them and her husband Robert's business dealings.
31,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,"I notice that Dr. Barren took a sip from her glass right after mentioning the potential sale of the farm, which seems unusual given how often we refill them throughout the day."
32,4,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I'm trying to piece together the events of Elizabeth's disappearance and potential murder by looking for inconsistencies in the stories told by the guests.
32,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,"I'm curious about the discrepancy in Elizabeth's account that wasn't mentioned before - $100,000 unexplained withdrawal."
32,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,"I've been trying to piece together the events of the past few days, considering all the clues and connections between the guests' stories. I'm wondering if Elizabeth's financial struggles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm might be more complex than initially thought, especially given her husband Robert's business dealings and the threatening letters she received."
32,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,6,I wonder if Dr. Barren is trying to distract us from her true intentions by bringing up the wine glasses every time it seems relevant?
32,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,"I wonder if Elizabeth's financial troubles might be more than just a simple case of overspending, and if there's anything suspicious about her unexplained withdrawal of $100,000 from her account."
32,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,8,I'm going to pay closer attention to the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and see if I can gather more information about who is refilling them.
33,4,Michael Nightshade,speak,5,I'm trying to piece together the events of the day and understand Elizabeth's motivations for wanting to sell the farm. I've been thinking about my aunt Kathryn Lawless's interest in buying the property and whether it might be more than just a coincidence. Maybe there's something I can do to help uncover what really happened to Elizabeth?
33,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,"I notice that Dr. Barren's glass was nearly empty before she took another sip, which seems unusual given how often we refill them throughout the day."
33,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I'm trying to piece together the events of Elizabeth's death and figure out who might be behind it. I've been paying attention to the conversations and looking for any inconsistencies or potential motives.
33,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,"I recall that Vicki D'Adly said she had received a phone call from an unknown number earlier that day, claiming they would reveal her financial situation unless she acquired the farm. I wonder if this might be connected to Elizabeth's unexplained withdrawal of $100,000 from her account just days before her disappearance."
33,4,Norman D'Adly,speak,5,"I wonder if Vicki's argument with Norman might be related to her financial struggles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm. I also think about Elizabeth's last conversation with her accountant, who informed her that Robert's estate was being audited due to some discrepancies in his business dealings."
33,4,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I wonder what Vicki's true intentions are for wanting to acquire the farm and why she was so insistent on discussing financial matters with Elizabeth before her disappearance.
34,4,Enrique Graves,listen,5,"I'm still trying to process the events of today and I remember that Elizabeth had been receiving threatening letters in the past few weeks, which she mentioned to me earlier this morning. She seemed quite shaken by them but didn't want to discuss further over coffee."
34,4,Michael Nightshade,listen,8,I think Dr. Barren is trying to distract us from something
34,4,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,This conversation is getting increasingly suspicious and I need to pay closer attention to the interactions between these people.
34,4,Norman D'Adly,listen,6,I wonder if Vicki D'Adly's hesitation about sharing the information about her financial difficulties and the threatening messages she received might be a sign of something more.
34,4,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,4,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly is more than just a coincidence... perhaps it's a deliberate attempt to distract us from something.
34,4,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I'll try to recall the conversation and see if I can find any connections between the suspicious behavior of some guests and Elizabeth's murder.
35,5,Kathryn Lawless,speak,5,I think it's interesting how everyone seems to be focusing on the farm's sale and potential motives for acquiring it. I also wonder if Elizabeth's husband Robert's business dealings might be more relevant to his estate than previously thought.
35,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,8,"I'm intrigued by the various arguments and motives presented in this conversation. It seems like each guest has a reason for wanting to acquire Elizabeth's farm, but which one is truly connected to her murder?"
35,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,I wonder if the threatening letters Elizabeth received were connected to her financial struggles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm.
35,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,8,"I'm trying to piece together the events of Elizabeth's life and death, looking for any inconsistencies or potential motives that could explain her murder."
35,5,Enrique Graves,listen,6,I wonder if Elizabeth's lawyer is hiding something about the prenuptial agreement and Robert's business dealings.
35,5,Michael Nightshade,speak,5,I wonder if I should investigate the discrepancy in Elizabeth's account further and see if it leads me anywhere
36,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,6,Consider that Michael Nightshade seemed to be lingering around the kitchen area for a few minutes after we finished drinking... I wonder if he might have been trying to gather some information or create a distraction.
36,5,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I've been thinking that Elizabeth's financial difficulties and the threatening letters she received might be connected to her husband Robert's business dealings and potential embezzlement of company funds.
36,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,7,I'm going to keep an eye on Dr. Barren's behavior and see if I can pick up any more subtle cues or inconsistencies in her responses.
36,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value seems suspicious given his aunt's complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth and Dr. Barren's mention of their complicated past.
36,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,7,"I wonder if the threatening letters and the phone calls from unknown numbers are connected, or if they're just separate incidents"
36,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,6,I'm going to think about Dr Chelsea Barren's past interactions with Robert Killingsworth and try to understand the complexity of their relationship.
37,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,9,Why is Elizabeth's lawyer being so secretive about the prenuptial agreement?
37,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,6,I have a question for Dr Chelsea Barren about her complicated relationship with Robert Killingsworth and how it might be related to the threatening letters Elizabeth received.
37,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,I wonder if Elizabeth's husband Robert was involved in her financial struggles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm.
37,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,"I'm going over the farm's financial records and I found a discrepancy in Elizabeth's account - there was an unexplained withdrawal of $10,000 from her account just days before her disappearance."
37,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,8,"I'm trying to piece together the various clues and inconsistencies that have come up during this conversation. I think there may be a connection between Elizabeth's financial struggles and some of the discrepancies in her account, such as the unexplained withdrawal of $100,000 and the transfer of $50,000 from Robert's trust to an offshore account. I'm also wondering if Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value might be more than just a coincidence."
37,5,Enrique Graves,listen,8,I wonder if the threatening letters and financial difficulties could be connected to Robert's business dealings or perhaps something more sinister.
38,5,Enrique Graves,listen,7,I wonder if Vicki's financial difficulties are more connected to her sister-in-law Elizabeth than they initially seemed...
38,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I'm going to take another sip from my glass and try to gather more information about Elizabeth's financial struggles and the potential motives for her murder.
38,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,7,"I wonder if Vicki's hesitation when asked about her financial difficulties might be related to the threatening messages she received from an unknown sender, and what exactly did Michael Nightshade mean by his interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value?"
38,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,I'm trying to piece together the events of the day and figure out who might be behind Elizabeth's murder.
38,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I've been thinking about the suspicious behavior of some of the guests and their potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm. I'm starting to wonder if there's more to this story than meets the eye.
38,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,7,"I wonder if Vicki's argument with Norman might have been more than just a family disagreement, especially considering the threats she received and her potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm."
39,5,Enrique Graves,listen,6,Michael Nightshade seemed particularly interested in acquiring the farm at a low market value and I wonder if there might be more to his story than meets the eye.
39,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,9,"I'm intrigued by the suspicious events unfolding at Killingsworth Farm and I wonder if there's a connection between Elizabeth's financial struggles, her argument with Vicki, and Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm."
39,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,"I need to investigate Elizabeth's financial records and her husband Robert's business dealings further to see if I can find any connections between the threatening messages, the prenuptial agreement, or the insurance policy upgrade."
39,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,I wonder if Vicki's argument with Norman might be connected to the threatening letters Elizabeth received and her financial struggles.
39,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,8,"I notice that several people have mentioned Vicki's financial difficulties and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm, as well as her argument with Norman about their differing views on Robert's estate management. I also recall that Elizabeth had been receiving threatening letters from an unknown sender, which she mentioned to me earlier this morning. The discrepancy in her account and the transfer of $50,000 from her husband's trust to an offshore account earlier this year seem suspicious given these circumstances."
39,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,8,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction from the true circumstances surrounding Elizabeth's murder.
40,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,8,I wonder if Elizabeth's financial struggles and potential motives for wanting to acquire the farm might be connected to her husband Robert's passing or his business dealings.
40,5,Enrique Graves,listen,7,I wonder if Michael Nightshade's unusual behavior is related to his interest in acquiring the farm... Perhaps he's hiding something about his true intentions?
40,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,"I've been thinking that Dr Chelsea Barren's behavior and comments seem suspicious, especially when she said 'I think I noticed' multiple times. It seems like she might be trying to manipulate the conversation or distract us from something. I'm also curious about Michael Nightshade's sudden interest in acquiring the farm and his strange behavior during the gathering."
40,5,Michael Nightshade,speak,7,I've been thinking about the conversation and all the suspicious comments made by the guests. I wonder if Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm at a low market value might be more than just coincidence. Did he ever discuss Elizabeth's financial struggles with his aunt or was it just a coincidence that she brought up the low market value?
40,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,8,"I've been trying to piece together the events of Elizabeth's disappearance and potential murder. I think there might be a connection between Vicki's financial difficulties, Robert's business dealings, and the threatening letters she received. Maybe someone was trying to intimidate her into selling the farm or acquiring certain assets from Robert's estate? I'm curious about Michael Nightshade's interest in acquiring the farm and whether it's connected to his aunt Kathryn Lawless's involvement."
40,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,9,I'm going to analyze the conversation and see if I can find any connections between the different clues and hints that have been dropped throughout the game.
41,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I wonder if Elizabeth's husband Robert had some knowledge of his wife's financial struggles and potentially shared this information with someone else.
41,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,"The group's dynamic seems complex and suspicious. They all seem to have a stake in acquiring the farm, but I'm not sure what their true motives are. I wonder if there's more to Vicki's argument with Elizabeth than just financial difficulties."
41,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I think it's suspicious that multiple people have mentioned threatening letters and financial difficulties around Elizabeth Killingsworth at the same time. It seems like they're all connected but I need more information to piece together what's really going on here.
41,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,6,I recall that Elizabeth had mentioned to me before arriving at the farm that she was planning to reorganize her estate and possibly transfer some assets to Vicki's name. I wonder if this might be connected to the threatening messages she received recently and the argument we had earlier today about financial matters.
41,5,Enrique Graves,listen,6,"I remember that Elizabeth Killingsworth had been planning to reorganize her estate and possibly transfer some assets to Vicki's name, which might be connected to the threatening messages she received recently and the argument we had earlier today about financial matters."
41,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,8,I'll think about the conversation so far and try to piece together what might have happened.
42,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I'm going to take a closer look at the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and try to gather more information about who might be behind it.
42,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,6,I'm curious about the timing of the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and how it might be related to Elizabeth's murder
42,5,Enrique Graves,listen,8,I need to review the conversation and see if I can find any connections between Elizabeth's death and the other guests' interests in acquiring the farm.
42,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,2,I'm going to keep observing the conversation and see if I can find any connections between the guests' statements.
42,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,4,I've been thinking about the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and how it seems like someone might be trying to create a distraction from the true circumstances surrounding Elizabeth's murder.
42,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,2,"I think I'll take some time to observe and listen carefully to the conversation, seeing if anyone mentions me by name or accuses me of something."
43,5,Enrique Graves,listen,8,"I'm trying to piece together the events of Elizabeth's death and figure out who might be involved. I've noticed that several people seemed suspicious or evasive when questioned about their whereabouts or motives. Michael Nightshade seems particularly interested in acquiring the farm, but his alibi for the time of Elizabeth's disappearance is unclear. Dr. Chelsea Barren mentioned receiving threatening letters from an unknown sender, which could be a motive for her to want to acquire the property. I also wonder if Vicki D'Adly might be involved, given her financial difficulties and argument with Elizabeth earlier today."
43,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,4,I've been thinking about the wine glasses being replenished so quickly and how it might be related to Dr. Barren's sips from her glass right after mentioning the potential sale of the farm. It seems like she was trying to distract us or create a diversion.
43,5,Norman D'Adly,speak,5,"I've been going over the farm's financial records and I found an additional discrepancy in Elizabeth's account - a transfer of $50,000 from her husband Robert's trust to an offshore account earlier this year. This transfer was not mentioned during our previous conversation about Robert's business dealings."
43,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,5,"I'm trying to remember if I noticed anything unusual around the time Elizabeth disappeared, and what was said about her financial situation during our conversation."
43,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction or send a subtle message.
43,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,5,"Interesting that Dr Barren took another sip from her glass before asking questions, seems like a subtle attempt to distract or create a diversion."
44,5,Kathryn Lawless,listen,8,I wonder if Elizabeth's argument with Vicki about her financial difficulties might be connected to the threatening messages she received recently and her decision to reorganize her estate.
44,5,Norman D'Adly,listen,5,I think I know what might be going on with the wine glasses being replenished so quickly... Maybe someone is trying to create a distraction or send a subtle message. I wonder if it's related to Elizabeth's financial struggles or something more sinister?
44,5,Dr Chelsea Barren,listen,5,I'm intrigued by the various alibis and excuses being shared. I wonder if anyone is hiding something or if they're just trying to deflect attention from their own guilt.
44,5,Enrique Graves,listen,5,I wonder if someone is trying to distract us from the main topic of conversation by constantly refilling the wine glasses
44,5,Michael Nightshade,listen,5,"I'm going to try and piece together what happened from the different conversations and clues that have been shared so far. I'll think about who might have had a motive for Elizabeth's murder, and whether any of the suspicious behavior we've observed could be connected."
44,5,Vicki D'Adly,listen,8,I wonder if the wine glasses being replenished so quickly could be related to a deliberate attempt to create a distraction from Elizabeth's murder. I also think that Michael Nightshade seemed overly interested in acquiring the farm and his behavior might be suspicious.
