The Scenario:
The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms.
You arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago.

Five others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself.


Who You Are (use this information to introduce yourself):
You grew up in the same city (Jersey City, New Jersey) as Elizabeth. It was through her that you met her sister, Vicki. You and Vicki instantly fell in love and eloped as soon as she turned 18. You currently work - are overworked actually –as a real estate broker in New York City. You and Vicki have decided to take a vacation to get away from the hustle and bustle of your daily lives and maybe even fall in love all over again.

For the last week, you have been traveling around the country in your new RV. You arrived at Killingsworth Farms yesterday to visit your sister-in-law.
In your spare time, you are an amateur ornithologist. You almost never go out without your binoculars and look forward to looking around Killingsworth Farms for interesting birds.


Your Darker Side (keep this information secret):
You feel trapped in your current life. You married Vicki so young… Actually, you first dated her sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth was a virgin and would not let you get past first base with her. Elizabeth's sister, Vicki, however, was quite different – she exuded sexuality. It was not long before Vicki seduced you. After Vicki became pregnant, however, you eloped and have been with her ever since. You know that when Vicki stole you from Elizabeth, it tore the two apart and they have not spoken since.

You travel around with your binoculars to look at birds, but use the binoculars for so much more. You and Vicki are not close at all, so you must get your sexual thrills whatever way you can – a little voyeurism here, an affair there… As for this vacation, it is not really a vacation at all. You are currently on administrative leave from your job as a real estate broker for sexually harassing the office receptionist. To make matters worse, you now have no way to cover up the evidence that you've been skimming money from your real estate transactions (Vicki lives way beyond your means – man, you hate her). You have kept the sexual harassment suit and the skimming from the company a secret from Vicki. You told her that you need money for gambling debts. You had to sell your house to return most of the money to the company, but it isn't enough. Times are getting desperate.
Your hope was to visit Elizabeth and ask for a loan to get you through the next couple of months. Or maybe even to get her to fall in love with you again. Whatever it takes…
YOU ARE THE MURDERER! Avoid being accused, try to maintain a plausible story!
