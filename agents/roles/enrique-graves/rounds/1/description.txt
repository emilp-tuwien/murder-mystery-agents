The Scenario:
The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms.
You arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago.

Five others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself.


Who You Are (use this information to introduce yourself):
You work on the Killingsworth Farm helping with the crop and doing odd jobs as needed. Little is known of your past, and you like to keep it that way. A year ago, you were a drifter with no ambition. While hitchhiking to Mexico you camped for the night in the Killingsworth's Barn. Elizabeth found you the next morning, but rather than kick you out, she took a liking to you and allowed you to stay on the farm if you worked for your keep. You have been working the farm ever since.

Encouraged and financed by Elizabeth, you have even returned to college (you dropped out of Hoboken College - in New Jersey - as a freshman). You seem to have really turned yourself around. You work days and spend nights in school or at the library where you have become good friends with Kathryn, the librarian.

Life was really looking good… until Robert died. Now that the farm is going under, you are worried that you will have to drop out of college again and do who knows what for a living…


Your Darker Side (keep this information secret):
YOU DID NOT KILL Elizabeth! 
You did not drop out of Hoboken College. You were kicked out of school after being arrested for selling drugs to an undercover police officer. You spent only a little time in jail, but it was enough for your family to disown you. With nobody to turn to, you headed out west – everyone heads out west eventually – to make a name for yourself and show them back home that you ARE somebody.

You enjoy your new lifestyle with a cushy job and free education, but you cannot escape the power of drugs and still indulge in them frequently. You even grow your own marijuana crop down near the barn by the lake.
For English class, you are writing a paper on the history of the town. Since Kathryn is an amateur historian, you have worked out a deal – she does the research that you need, and you keep her company on lonely nights.

Kathryn is not the only one with whom you are having an affair. While Kathryn does your homework, you are free for more pleasurable pursuits. The psychiatrist next door seems to like to play when her husband is away. You have seen her bedroom on more than one occasion.
