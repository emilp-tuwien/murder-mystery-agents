The Scenario:
You have returned to the Wine Vaults with a flashlight in hand. In the light, you can see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost get lost. Coming upon the body, you confirm that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately see the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appears to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevents you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decide to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

You last saw Elizabeth Killingsworth alive during lunch. Around 4:00 PM, you quickly drove back to the library and checked out a copy of Dr. Chelsea Barren's last book. Soon afterwards, you were sitting on Killingsworth Farm's back porch reading the book and waiting for Elizabeth to finish showing Michael Nightshade around the farm. She never returned.
At around 6:45 PM, you noticed Dr. Chelsea Barren come from her house next door. She followed someone into the Wine Vaults. Moments later, the lights in the window of the Wine Vaults flicker and go out.
