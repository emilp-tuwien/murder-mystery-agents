I was in the Rose Garden this afternoon with Elizabeth Killingsworth. She was showing me around the Farm. I probably could have picked up the corkscrew when Elizabeth dropped it, but I did not do so. My mind was elsewhere.

I am not exactly who I appear to be. And I am not the only one. My Aunt, Kathryn Lawless, is not exactly the best friend to Elizabeth that she would make us believe.

I am not a real estate developer. I am a junior executive trainee at a real estate brokerage in New York City. I came to see Elizabeth in order to buy her farm inexpensively. While helping Enrique Graves with his college research, Kathryn uncovered clues to millions of dollars in gold somewhere in the Killingsworth Farm fields. This was a secret she kept even from me.

Kathryn and I first planned to buy Elizabeth's farm outright – I was to buy the farm and sell it to Kathryn afterwards at a tidy profit. Unfortunately, Elizabeth's asking price was much more than I could afford on my modest salary.
Unable to persuade Elizabeth to lower her selling-price enough, Kathryn decided to take our plan to the next level. She was desperate to escape her mundane life here in Marcocain and obtaining the gold on the Killingsworth Farm would have provided her with the financial freedom to pursue all of her life's dreams.
While I was out seeing the grounds with Elizabeth, Kathryn stole some sleeping pills from Elizabeth's medicine cabinet and slipped them to me later while I was making phone calls from my car.

I crushed the sleeping pills and slipped them into Elizabeth's wine while we were wine-tasting in the vaults just before she was killed. Kathryn had forged a suicide note for Elizabeth with instructions that Kathryn should be given the Killingsworth Farm. Kathryn was trying to get the farm for free and leave me completely out of the picture - without even having made a profit selling the land to her. Had I known that Kathryn was trying to give me the shaft, I would never have gone along with her crazy plan. I admit that I tried to kill Elizabeth, but somebody else got to her first. I certainly did not stab her in the neck with a corkscrew.
