Handwritten yellowed letter stamped “Marcocain Public Library – Vertical Files G47-06”




Marcocain, Cal September 18, 1850 Dear Sister,
I want you to come join me. I want you to bring John, Virginia, and Little Bill. This land is unequaled and the world has never presented such a picture as California now presents.
This letter must reach you in confidence, however. I have found an untapped vein of gold in the valley on my farm. God willing, it may yield hundreds if not thousands of pounds of gold! I need to mine that gold, but have invested everything I own in this farm. Others are arriving fast from far away states to prospect. I will keep them from my find as long as possible, but we must move swiftly. I need money to hire men I can trust. I must keep this a secret as long as possible. If you can, sell your property and bring all the money you can.

I will write again shortly and instruct you how to cross the plains. From Your Affectionate Brother
Samuel Friedmont
