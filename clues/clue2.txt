Man Whose Body Found in Lake Identified
Marcocain police have identified the man found floating in Friedmont Mill Lake last week as Robert Killingsworth, 41, a Vineyard and Winery owner from Marcocain.
Killingsworth's body was identified through his fingerprints, said homicide Detective Michael Noall. He said Killingsworth's body was found April 21 at 1:30 p.m. by boaters.

An autopsy determined he died from blunt head trauma.

Killingsworth lived and worked at Killingsworth Farm Vineyard and Winery off Route 41 in Marcocain, where he was last seen two weeks ago. Detective Noall said Robert's wife, Elizabeth Killingsworth, reported her husband's disappearance to police after he failed to meet her in town for dinner.
An officer in the missing persons detail matched fingerprints on file with those of Killingsworth's body, Noall said.

Anyone with information about Killingsworth's death is encouraged to contact the Marcocain Police Department. Elizabeth Killingsworth is offering a $10,000 reward for information.
