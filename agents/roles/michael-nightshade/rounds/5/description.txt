The Scenario:
You can hear the wail of distant police sirens. Soon investigators will be swarming Killingsworth Farms and asking questions you may not want to answer. You still have a few minutes, though, and there are a few issues with your fellow guests you want to clear up…


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
Earlier in the day, you bumped into Vicki D'Adly and, thinking it was Elizabeth, began asking her questions about the extent of the farmlands. Vicki interrupted you to tell you that she was not Elizabeth. Vicki and Elizabeth look nearly identical.

You recognize the handwriting on Elizabeth Killingsworth's suicide note (Secret Clue – Round 4). It matches the note scribbled on the bottom of the letter by Samuel Friedmont (Secret Clue – Round 3)
