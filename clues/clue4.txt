Note written on Killingsworth Farm letterhead dated today:




Dearest Kathryn,

As you know, times have been hard since Robert's death. I struggle each day to find the strength to go on. The thought of selling my home – Killingsworth Farm – is too much to bear, but as you know, I can no longer afford the farm's upkeep - let alone wine production.
I am lost. I am alone. Tonight, when I fall asleep, I do not plan to see the morning – my sleeping pills should ensure that I never awake.
You have been so good to Robert and I this last year, and you are truly my best friend. I want you to have Killingsworth Farm. Run it, sell it, or do with it whatever makes you happy.
With Heartfelt Gratitude,

-Elizabeth Killingsworth
