I have never stopped loving Elizabeth Killingsworth. Even after marrying her sister, Vicki, I could never stop thinking of Elizabeth. I came to Killingsworth Farm not only because my job was in jeopardy and I needed a loan, but because I wanted to leave Vicki and marry Elizabeth.

I bought Elizabeth the golden corkscrew as a gift and told her of my intentions. Elizabeth, however, said she could never forgive me for leaving her so many years ago. I still loved Elizabeth and hoped that one day we would be together again. For the time being, however, I found myself stuck with Vicki to whom I despise being married.

I was at the Gazebo in the Rose Garden tonight when I saw Vicki kissing the farmhand, Enrique Graves. I was so enraged that I wanted them dead that very moment. I saw the corkscrew that I had given to Elizabeth laying in the grass and believed it was a sign. I slipped the corkscrew into my pocket.

After a few minutes, Enrique and Vicki split up and left the Rose Garden. I followed Enrique to the Wine Vault and watched him turn off the electricity from the main power switch in the rear of the building. He then walked down a maze of halls and he began working on some exposed wires. Doubling back, I returned to the electrical box and turned on the electricity. I heard a sharp crack of electricity and the lights went dark. I could hear Vicki scream. She must have seen Enrique get shocked.

Fumbling down the passageways, I made my way toward the sound of Vicki's scream. Suddenly I was standing behind her. I pulled the corkscrew from my pocket and slammed it into the side of her neck. She fell to the floor - her blood spilling everywhere.

I ran back to the Farmhouse to figure out what to do next when I found everyone gathering in the main hall. To my horror, Vicki stood among the group of strangers. That is when I realized my terrible mistake. I did not know that Elizabeth was in the Wine Vault. Elizabeth must have been wandering the halls following Vicki's scream. In the dark I assumed she was Vicki, as they look nearly identical even in good lighting. I thought I was killing my wife, but instead, killed the only woman I've ever truly loved. I killed Elizabeth Killingsworth.
