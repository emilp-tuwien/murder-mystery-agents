Round Four – The Examination
The Scenario:
You have returned to the Wine Vaults with a flashlight in hand. In the light, you can see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost get lost. Coming upon the body, you confirm that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately see the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appears to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevents you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decide to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
You last saw Elizabeth Killingsworth alive around 5:30 PM while you were taking a break. Elizabeth was heading into the Wine Vaults with Michael Nightshade.
At 6:30 PM, you went to the Wine Vault to work on the short in the wiring. You were sure that you turned off the electricity, but at about 6:45 PM you were shocked by a jolt of electricity that knocked you unconscious for the next quarter of an hour. The jolt of electricity must have shorted out the lights in the Wine Vault.
Dr. Chelsea Barren was almost as devastated by Robert Killingsworth's death as Elizabeth. You wonder just why Dr. Barren is so interested in the life and death Robert. Her interest seems too extreme to be strictly professional.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
At 5:30 PM, you were cleaning the Fountain in the Rose Garden when Vicki approached you. You talked for a while. The two of you began to flirt and were soon kissing passionately.
