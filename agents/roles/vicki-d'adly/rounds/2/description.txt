The Scenario:
A quarter of an hour has passed. You hastily gulped down a glass of the Killingsworth Farm wine, but a somber mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of uninvited guests. One of the other guests – you do not notice who – suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.
You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this opportunity to find out more about the others.

What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
Norman D'Adly was not in bed when you woke up and you did not see him again until that afternoon. This was fine with you as you enjoyed the peace and quiet for once.
You hear that Dr. Chelsea Barren is writing a novel about a man who was bludgeoned to death and dumped into a lake. The murder goes unsolved. The plot line sounds vaguely familiar. You wonder which of the suspects Dr. Barren believes is the killer.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
You did not know that Robert Killingsworth had died before this visit. Apparently Elizabeth still had not forgiven you for marrying her high school sweetheart and did not want to see you. You wonder if she wanted you out of her life for good.
You met Elizabeth Killingsworth for a private breakfast this morning at around 9:30 AM. You mentioned that you were having some financial difficulties and asked Elizabeth for help. Elizabeth, however, was financially strapped, as Robert had no life insurance when he died.
