My life has revolved around books. That is why I became a librarian. Some people, however, might call me a dreamer. I will admit that I have always longed for a more exciting life.

Tonight has been especially exciting for me. For once, I do not have to be content just reading a mystery in one of my library books. I can finally live the adventure.

As a mystery novel fan, I've learned the crucial factors in solving any murder. The killer must have a motive to murder, the means to commit the crime, and the opportunity to do so.

I was Elizabeth Killingsworth's best friend. I would never have dreamed of killing her. In fact, I could not have killed her. We know that Elizabeth was murdered in the Wine Vaults this evening. I was nowhere near the Wine Vaults today.

Furthermore, Elizabeth was found with a corkscrew jutting out of her neck. Earlier today, Elizabeth told me that Norman D'Adly had given that same corkscrew to her as a gift. He had even inscribed it to her. Elizabeth mentioned that she dropped the corkscrew in the Rose Garden today after being stung by a bee. She rushed back to the Farmhouse for treatment. The time was 1:00 PM.
Only the people who were in the Rose Garden today would have had access to the murder weapon used to kill Elizabeth. I am innocent.
