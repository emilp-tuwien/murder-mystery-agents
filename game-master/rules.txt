You are about to become a suspect in a murder mystery. It is up to you to figure out whodunit by denouncing the guilty secrets of others while trying to prove your innocence.

Please remain in character throughout the game.

Game play will proceed in Rounds.

Each round will provide information for you to reveal and clues you will use to interrogate each suspect in the mystery.

Players must answer questions according the information in their suspect dossier. Suspects that have guilty secrets may be given misleading information to help keep their secrets a secret. It is up to you to sift through this misleading information to discover the truth.
“Secret Clues” will provide special information used to further the mystery. These clues should be revealed only when a suspect dossier instructs a player to do so. Once revealed, secret clues should be made available to everyone for examination throughout the game.

Rounds end only when all players have revealed all facts and secrets in the suspect dossier.

At the end of Round Five, all players will be given the opportunity to write down their solution to the mystery: Whodunit? How? And Why?

Round Six should begin once all players have read their accusation to the group.

Round Six will provide each player with a code word that corresponds to his or her Confession Statement. The Confession Statements provide the correct solution to the mystery and must be read in order. The first Confession Statement will be read by the player given the code word MYSTERY in Round Six. The Confession Statement marked MYSTERY will indicate which coded Confession Statement should be read next and so forth until all Confession Statements have been read and the solution to the mystery is revealed.
The Winner of the game is the person whose accusation form most closely matches the actual solution to the mystery as revealed in Round Six.
