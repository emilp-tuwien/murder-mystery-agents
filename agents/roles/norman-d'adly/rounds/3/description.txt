The Scenario:
Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, the sound of screaming draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault – an expansive wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth.

The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
Vicki is Elizabeth's only living relative. She is the rightful heir to the Killingsworth Farm now that Elizabeth is dead.

Around 3:45 PM, you overhead a heated conversation between Elizabeth Killingsworth and Dr. Chelsea Barren. Elizabeth was telling Chelsea that she would rather deny any evidence in the murder of Robert Killingsworth than let Chelsea expose any of it in her book.
Everytime you have seen Enrique today, he seemed to be looking underneath furniture, in drawers, etc. as if he had lost something.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
During your conversation at 10:30 AM this morning with Elizabeth in the Rose Garden, she told you that Vicki had told her that you have been physically abusive to her. You were shocked, as you have never laid a finger on Vicki.
You received a phone call today at 1:00 PM from your boss. For the last couple of weeks, you have been on administrative leave for sexual harassing your office receptionist. While performing necessary checks for the upcoming lawsuit, your boss had found evidence that you had been siphoning money from the company into your personal account. He called to inform you that you are fired.
