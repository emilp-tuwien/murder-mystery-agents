The Scenario:
Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, the sound of screaming draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault – an expansive wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth.

The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
At 1:30 PM, Dr. Chelsea Barren seemed to invite herself to lunch with you, Kathryn Lawless, and Elizabeth. You could sense that Elizabeth was uncomfortable. She admitted to you later that she hates Dr. Chelsea Barren.

During lunch, you took a peek through Dr. Barren's notebook and noticed her notes regarding Robert Killingsworth's murder. Dr. Barren seems to think that Robert was killed in his own home - a drop of blood was found on the carpet in front of his study computer, his files had been rifled through, and his phone was off of the hook. Elizabeth believes the bloodstain had been there for years. She could not explain the disarray of the phone or papers, however.

Michael Nightshade looks very familiar and you finally recognize him. You met him last year at Norman's company holiday party. They must work at the same real estate brokerage firm. You did not know that the company developed land, though - and certainly not in California.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
You lied to Elizabeth this morning at breakfast. You told her that Norman was physically abusive to you, but your lies were just an attempt to gain Elizabeth's sympathy. You partially wanted to see how she would react to the news, but also to see if she still had feelings for Norman. Elizabeth did seem surprised that Norman was abusive, but she told you that you got what you deserved. You want to divorce Norman, but you rely on him too much financially.
You had to sell your home because of Norman's debts. You are now living in your RV.
