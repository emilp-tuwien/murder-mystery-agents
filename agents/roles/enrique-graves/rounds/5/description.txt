The Scenario:
You can hear the wail of distant police sirens. Soon investigators will be swarming Killingsworth Farms and asking questions you may not want to answer. You still have a few minutes, though, and there are a few issues with your fellow guests you want to clear up…


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
The day that Robert Killingsworth was killed, he had lunch with Dr. Chelsea Barren. She pleaded with him to see her the next day as well, but Robert refused. Chelsea continued to beg, but Robert said he would only let her back on his property over his “dead body.” You wonder if that was just an expression…

Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
You were the last person to see Robert Killingsworth alive.
