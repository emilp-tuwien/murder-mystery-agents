The Scenario:
The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms.
You arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago.

Five others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself.


Who You Are (use this information to introduce yourself):
You are Elizabeth Killingsworth's best friend. Elizabeth often volunteered at the local library where, for the last ten years, you have been the head (and only) librarian. You are unmarried, but have several nieces and nephews on which you dote almost as much as your fifteen cats.

Not only are you the town's librarian, but it's historian (and biggest gossip) as well. It is almost impossible to keep a secret in such a small town and you are proud of the fact that you know everything about everybody. You have read every novel by Agatha Christie, Patricia Cornwell and, of course, Lilian Jackson Braun (The Cat Who… series). Sometimes, on rainy days, you feel like picking up a Steven King…
Today, you dropped by the Killingsworth Farm to visit Elizabeth and savor a nice cup of tea. You are sad that Elizabeth is selling the farm and are going to miss her terribly when she moves back to the East Coast.


Your Darker Side (keep this information secret):

YOU DID NOT KILL Elizabeth! 
Enrique, the Killingsworth Farm farmhand, is writing a paper on the history of the town for his college English course. He came to you one day and worked out a deal – you do the research he needs, and he keeps you company on lonely nights. He is beautiful, and you are single… In the back of your mind, though, you know he is only using you.
As you dug deeper into the history of Marcocain, you uncovered an interesting story about the previous owner of Killingsworth Farm who discovered a gold vein on the property. With a little more research using that new- fangled Internet thing you figured out that the farmer died before mining the gold, and it could still be buried on the land. You called the one nephew you have in real estate to come and buy the farm from Elizabeth and sell it to you for at a small profit. You like Elizabeth, but the thought of such a great deal of money and a life outside this small town is too tempting.
