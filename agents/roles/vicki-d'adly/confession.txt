I did see Enrique Graves get shocked and fall unconscious. That is true. It is also true that I was with him in the Rose Garden at 5:30 PM and could have had access to the corkscrew.

I will be the first to admit that my sister and I did not get a long. Until this weekend, Elizabeth Killingsworth and I have been estranged since high school when I stole her boyfriend away and married him. What a mistake that was! Recently, we had to sell hour house because Norman was sued for sexual harassing a co-worker. I also know that he has been stealing from his company to pay his debts.
I do not want to be married to Norman any longer. Even after I lied to Elizabeth and told her that Norman was beating me, she would not – or could not – give me a loan to start a new life.

I was more appalled to find out that Norman still loved Elizabeth and was scheming to become a part of her life again.

It dawned on me that if I killed Elizabeth, I would be her closest living relative and would inherit her money. I would then be free to move to Hollywood to become a star. The only downside is that I would have had to share the money with Norman. A more sensible plan, I decided, would be to divorce Norman before knocking off Elizabeth.

I believe that Dr. Chelsea Barren was spying on me at the time of Elizabeth's death. She can attest to the fact that I did not kill my sister.
