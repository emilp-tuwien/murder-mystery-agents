Round Four – The Examination
The Scenario:
You have returned to the Wine Vaults with a flashlight in hand. In the light, you can see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost get lost. Coming upon the body, you confirm that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately see the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appears to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevents you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decide to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
You looked at the clock in the Wine Vaults. It stopped when the power went out at 6:45 PM. Where was everybody? Who was the last person to see Elizabeth Killingsworth alive? You last saw Elizabeth at 3:45 PM when you had a brief conversation with her in the farmhouse about your upcoming novel. You left Elizabeth and went home and call your publisher.

At 5:30 PM, you were swimming in your pool when you saw Enrique Graves and Vicki D'Adly in the Rose Garden. By the time you got out of the pool to find out what was going on, Vicki had left.
About 6:45 PM, you saw Vicki D'Adly heading toward the Wine Vault. You noticed that she was wearing a different outfit than she had been that afternoon. You also noticed that Kathryn Lawless was sitting on the back porch of Killingsworth Farmhouse watching you, but you followed Vicki into the Wine Vault anyway. You trailed her as she made her way through the labyrinth of halls never letting her out of your sight…


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
You loved Robert Killingsworth. You had an affair with him just prior to his death. Elizabeth suspected the affair an confronted Robert about it. Robert and Elizabeth decided to seek counseling to try to save their marriage. Robert broke off his affair with you immediately. He died only days later.
