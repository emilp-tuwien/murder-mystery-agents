The Scenario:
A quarter of an hour has passed. You hastily gulped down a glass of the Killingsworth Farm wine, but a somber mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of uninvited guests. One of the other guests – you do not notice who – suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.
You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this opportunity to find out more about the others.

What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
Around 9:30 AM this morning, you were cleaning the farmhouse windows from outside when you heard Vicki D'Adly sobbing and speaking to someone. She was in the breakfast room at the time.

When Robert Killingsworth died, Elizabeth felt alone and distraught. She had no other living family except her sister, whom she said she had not seen since high school. Elizabeth wanted to make amends with her sister, but said that she never wanted to see her brother-in-law again. She never made contact with her sister.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
Around 12:45 PM, Dr. Chelsea Barren came to you and asked about the man who had driven up to Killingsworth Farm (Michael Nightshade). You did a little snooping for her and found out that he was a real estate developer who intended to buy the farm to develop it into low-cost housing. You reported this news back to Dr. Barren at about 1 PM. She seemed horrified by the thought of low-cost housing next to her property. She vowed to put a stop to the plan.

You have been at the library a lot this week as Kathryn Lawless has been helping you with your homework.

Elizabeth Killingsworth was especially attentive and generous to you immediately following Robert's death. You think that she was afraid you would leave the farm and she would be alone.
