The Scenario:
Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, the sound of screaming draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault – an expansive wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth.

The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.


What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):
After Elizabeth was stung by a bee in the Rose Garden, she hurried back to the farmhouse to tend to her wound. You spent the next two hours in your car making business calls.

At 3:00 PM, Elizabeth had not come back out of the farmhouse, so you decided to look around the farm on your own. At about 3:15 PM, you saw a woman enter the Wine Vaults. You could see Enrique Graves inside the door and the two were speaking conspiratorially. You walked away and did not see when the woman came out of the Wine Vaults.


Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):
You are not a real estate developer. You are a junior executive trainee for a real estate brokerage in New York. You are trying to make a name for yourself within the company. You wanted to buy the land cheap to sell high later and prove your business-savvy to the company higher-ups.

Kathryn Lawless is your Aunt. She gave you the tip to come to California to buy the Killingsworth Farm. You do not have much money, though. Kathryn, however, promised to buy it back from you afterwards at a profit. She did not tell you why, but seemed quite eager to get her hands on the land. It is all moot, however, because Elizabeth was asking more for the farm than you could afford. You spent much of the day making calls to get more money and talking to Elizabeth to get her to lower her price.
